Plant.create(name: "Cabbage", description: "Cabbage (Brassica oleracea) is a leafy biennial plant grown as an annual, known for its dense, compact head of smooth or crinkled leaves. It thrives in cool climates and well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Cabbage plants have a shallow root system and require consistent moisture to develop firm, healthy heads. The outer leaves spread wide, protecting the inner layers as the plant matures. Available in green, red, and savoy varieties, cabbage is resistant to frost and can tolerate colder temperatures better than many other leafy plants. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, related to broccoli, cauliflower, and kale. Cabbage is susceptible to pests like cabbage worms and aphids, requiring careful cultivation and pest management. When left to flower, cabbage produces tall stalks with yellow blossoms that eventually seed. Its strong adaptability and high yield make it a staple in many gardens and agricultural systems worldwide.", amount_of_sun: 35, days_to_water: 3)
